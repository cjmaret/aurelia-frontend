## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- Backend server running locally (e.g., FastAPI on `http://localhost:8000`).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```git clone https://github.com/your-username/conversant-ai-frontend.git```
   ```cd conversant-ai-frontend```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```npm install```

3. Start the app:
   ```npx expo start```

## üñ•Ô∏è Running the App

### On Physical Device (Expo Go)

1. Start the app:
   ```npx expo start```

2. Open the Expo Go app on your device (available on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)).

3. Scan the QR code displayed in the terminal or Expo CLI output.

4. Ensure your backend server is accessible from your device:
   - Run the app: 
      ```uvicorn app.app:app --reload```
   - Run the app to allow calls from Expo Go:
      ```uvicorn app.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload```
   - Replace `localhost` in your API URL (in config file) with your machine's local IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.x.x:8000`).
      - can be found via `ifconfig | grep inet`
   - If on a public network, use the `--tunnel` flag when running the Expo app:
     ```npx expo start --tunnel```


5. Make sure your device and development machine are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
